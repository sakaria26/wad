      The 5th International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Humanity
      (ICATH 2023) will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 20 to 23 May 2023.
      The conference will be hosted by the University of Geneva in collaboration
      with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Other
      institutions in Switzerland and abroad will also be involved in the
      organization of the conference. These include the University of Zurich,
      Namibia University of Science and Technology, Masaryk University,
      University of Ljubljana, University of Belgrade, University of Novi Sad
      and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      ICATH 2023 aims to bridge the ignored gap between science and engineering,
      and humanity. Advancements made in science and engineering should work
      hand in hand with the humanity aspect for them to have a meaningful
      impact. This conference like it's predecessors, aims to be the meeting
      point for researchers and practitioners, enabling the implementation of
      advanced technologies in various sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>All Accepted papers</b> will be published in the conference proceedings
      and submitted for inclusion in the <b>IEEE Xplore Digital Library</b>.
      They will also be available on the ICATH 2023 website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference will be designed and prepared as an in-person event.
      However, in the case of perduring traveling restrictions during the
      conference dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be ready to convert
      the conference to a fully on-line event.
